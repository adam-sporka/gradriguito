# GRADRIGUITO RULE FILE
# Use terminal symbols ?_- to produce audio samples. Use non-terminal symbols
# to define sequences of terminal symbols and non-terminal symbols. Hash
# character means a comment.
#
# Define your wave forms, notes, and music in the same grammar!
# Some of your rules can be wave forms, use those to create notes of a given
# length, use these notes to write a melody, concatenate into measures.
#
# HOW TO RUN
# Use the command prompt to generate wav files
# gradriguito.exe tutorial.gto outputfile.wav "L"
#    will read the rulefile.gto, will output to outputfile.wav, and will start
#    with the rule "L".
#
# REWRITE RULES
#  * The format is <non-terminal>: <sequence>
#    i.e., a non-terminal is expanded into a sequence of non-terminal and
#    terminal symbols.
#  * Terminal symbols output the individual samples of a .wav file
#  * Non-terminal symbols rewrite as sequences of terminal and non-terminal
#    symbols. Avoid cycles! (E.g. A: __B, B: AA)
*  * All other symbols are ignored (tip: Spaces make the rules more legible)
#
# TERMINAL SYMBOLS
# ? ... output a random sample between -16 and 16
# _ ... output -16
# - ... output 16
#
# NON-TERMINAL SYMBOLS
# Letters A through Z
